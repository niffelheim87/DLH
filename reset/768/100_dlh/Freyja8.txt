Long shot of a blonde woman with turquoise blue skin and long hair parted down the middle. She has arched eyebrows, red eyes with black eyeliner, a small nose, and a slight smile as she reads a paper held in both hands. She wears a black headband with a diamond-shaped ruby and a lumberjack plaid shirt with a white t-shirt underneath. She sits on a wooden table inside a tavern, with a beer mug on her right. Behind her, there are wooden stairs leading up to a higher floor and an arched doorway that leads to another room.
