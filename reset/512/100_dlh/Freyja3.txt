a woman with blonde hair, long with a middle part, turquoise blue skin, arched eyebrows, red eyes with black eyeliner looking backwards, a diamond-shaped ruby headband, a small nose, and an open mouth with a surprised expression. She is wearing a pink cat-themed sweater with two kitten faces and paw prints. The woman is sitting with her back facing the camera, her legs bent, and she is reading a magazine. There is a stack of books to her right, and she is sitting on a red circle. The background is a light pink salmon color.
