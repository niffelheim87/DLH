Animated webcomic featuring a playful blonde woman with light pink skin, long straight hair parted down the middle. She has a mischievous expression on her face and medium-sized breasts. Standing barefoot, she strikes a dance pose called "finger-gun," with both hands pointing like pistols in the same direction on her waist. She wears a red large strapless dress that is open on one side, revealing her leg. Beneath her feet is a purple circle, creating a shadow-like effect. The background consists of three horizontal stripes in the following order: violet, turquoise, and purple. Pixelated, giant hearts in pink with black and white outlines decorate the background.
