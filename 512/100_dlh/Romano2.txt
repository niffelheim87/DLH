A close-up shot from the back of a muscular, gray-haired Roman soldier with a mane, looking sideways with his arm down and an open mouth. The soldier has facial scars and wears a golden armor with short red Roman cape that reveal the nape of his neck. In the background, there is a stone archway, walls, and a war table.
